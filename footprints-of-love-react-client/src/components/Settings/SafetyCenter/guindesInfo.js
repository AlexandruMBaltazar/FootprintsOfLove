                flirty messages, getting to know each other. But if it ever

                  Got a date coming up? Nice! We’re here to help you stay safe:
                  not only on Badoo, but in real life too. So, if you’re
                  absolutely ready to meet up, let’s get you prepared.
                </span>
                <h3>Set up a video call</h3>
                <span>
                  This way, you can make sure they are who they say they are.
                  It’s also a great way to break the ice before it’s time to
                  meet.
                </span>
                <h3>Check their social media</h3>
                <span>
                  We all do it. And we should. It’s a good chance to do your
                  research and find anything that might be suspicious. Keep in
                  mind, though, that they might be inactive or not on social
                  media at all.
                </span>
                <h3>Watch out for red flags</h3>
                <span>
                  Does something not feel quite right? Maybe they said something
                  inappropriate or they’re declining your video call
                  invitations. It’s cool to cancel the date if you have doubts
                  or feel uncomfortable. Just make sure you communicate first.
                </span>
                <h3>Watch out for red flags</h3>

                  Does something not feel quite right? Maybe they said something
                  inappropriate or they’re declining your video call

                  or feel uncomfortable. Just make sure you communicate first.
                </span>
                <h3>Arrange your own transport</h3>
                <span>
                  Getting your transport sorted before your date is a wise move.
                  It means you can keep your address private and leave whenever
                  you need to.
                </span>
                <h3>Tell someone you trust</h3>
                <span>
                  Keep your friends or family members in the loop. Update them
                  on everything, like who your date is, where you’re going and
                  when you get home.
                </span>
                <h3>Agree to meet in a public place</h3>
                <span>
                  There’s no need to share your address or go to their place –
                  at least while you don’t know each other that well. Plus, if
                  you ever need help while you’re on your date, you can ask the
                  staff or other people around you.

                  Your first date should be fun. Sure, it might be awkward at
                  first (that’s totally normal, by the way), and it can be a
                  little nerve-wracking too. But it should never be unsafe.
                  Here’s what you can do to ease your mind, stay safe and focus
                  on having fun.
                </span>
                <h3>Keep an eye on your things</h3>
                <span>
                  This includes your personal items, like your bag or phone. And
                  if you get a drink, make sure you always keep it with you.
                </span>
                <h3>Keep your phone on</h3>
                <span>
                  Make sure it’s fully charged and within reach too. This way,
                  you can keep friends or family members updated, or tell them
                  if anything goes wrong.
                </span>
                <h3>Listen to your gut</h3>
                <span>
                  Don’t ignore red flags or suspicious behaviour. Always trust
                  your instincts.
                </span>
                <h3>Stay in a public place</h3>
                <span>
                  It’s likely you don’t know your date that well just yet. So,
                  you should never feel pressured to go back to their place or
                  somewhere private if you don’t want to.
                </span>
                <h3>Leave if you feel uncomfortable</h3>
                <span>
                  If something doesn’t feel right or you don’t feel safe,
                  politely tell them you have to go, then leave. Your safety
                  comes first.
                </span>

                <span>
                  During Covid, staying in has been the new going out. Meeting
                  up can be risky, so here’s everything you should consider
                  before you go from Badoo to real life.
                </span>
                <h3>Suggest a video call</h3>
                <span>
                  Why not watch a film together, play a game or just have a nice
                  chat? A virtual date can be a fun, casual way of getting to
                  know each other. Plus, it’s a great opportunity to break the
                  ice in time for a real-life date.
                </span>
                <h3>Communicate your concerns</h3>
                <span>
                  Remember – any concerns you have are real and valid. So, if
                  your potential date tries to minimise them or make you feel
                  foolish, it’s OK to cancel the date. If they become rude or
                  disrespectful, you can block them. Your safety always comes
                  first.
                </span>
                <h3>Be open and honest</h3>
                <span>
                  Talk to each other about where you’ve been during Covid and
                  the kind of dates you’re comfortable with. If you’re both on
                  the same page, that’s a good start for a great date.
                </span>
                <h3>Go somewhere that suits you both</h3>
                <span>
                  Whether you’re meeting outside or at an indoor venue, make
                  sure it’s a place you’re both comfortable with. Always respect
                  each other’s boundaries and don’t compromise yours just to
                  please your date.
                </span>
                <h3>Consider the people around you</h3>
                <span>
                  During Covid, it’s important to be considerate of the people
                  you live and work with. So, if you’re meeting up, it’s a good
                  time to find out how your date feels about physical contact
                  and social distancing.
